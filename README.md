# My CS Journey
I Began fully learning about computer science in high school where I made simple projects such as games and websites. Around Year 9 we began to learn about AI which interested me deeply. I later went home that night and using simple python IF statements. I knew this was inefficient but due to my lack of coding knowledge couldn't advance.
